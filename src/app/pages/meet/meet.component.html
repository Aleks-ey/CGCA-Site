                    It is so exciting to find so many Georgians coming to Colorado and making it their home.

At last found the way to do that through Colorado Georgian Community Association - Ertoba. It`s about time!" - Tamara

Falling in love with Georgia, like many who have been fortunate enough to visit, I returned to Georgia each year before meeting my lovely wife, Tea Todua. Now we have three little Georgian/American daughters. I am excited to help the Colorado Georgian Community Association become a reality.
