          Tamara was born and raised in Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia and moved
          to the United States in 1992. First she lived in Atlanta, GA. and in
          1998 Tamara and her family moved to Denver, CO and never left from
          here. She fell in love with Colorado weather, history, people and
          after 26 years of living in Denver, this is her home.
          <br /><br />
          Tamara has over 30 years of experience in financial investments,
          wealth management, legal and real estate industries. With experience
          as a Merrill Lynch Global Wealth and Investment Management financial
          advisor, Tamara found a company Tsaava Asset Strategies Consultants
          specializing in marriage/divorce financial analysis and planning. She
          partners with Usaj Realty Co. and helps her clients buy, sell and
          invest in real estate.

          It is so exciting to find so many Georgians coming to Colorado and
          making it their home. For a long time I wanted to find ways to promote
          Georgian culture and history in Colorado and United States of America.
          At last found the way to do that through Colorado Georgian Community
          Association - Ertoba. It`s about time!" - Tamara

          Born and raised in the city of Sochi, Ruslan always had a passion for
          learning and exloring culture. After completing his early education in
          Sochi, he went on to pursue his studies in theology at the Tbilisi
          Theological Seminary and the Gelati Theological Academy and Seminary
          in Kutaisi, Georgia.
          <br /><br />
          In 2001, Ruslan made a life-changing decision to move to the United
          States with his wife and two sons.
          <br /><br />
          Ruslan is a respected member of the local community and is dedicated
          to making a positive impact in the world. He currently works as a
          contractor helping people renovate and build their properties, and
          with his wealth of knowledge and experience has become a trusted
          expert in his field, always looking for ways to provide exceptional
          service to his clients.
          <br /><br />
          After his third son was born in the U.S.A., he started to see how
          important it was to preserve Georgian culture and traditions over
          generations. This led him to join forces with fellow Georgians to
          start the Colorado Georgian Community Association.

          My first visit to Tbilisi, Georgia was in 2008 to visit a possible
          business opportunity. This resulted in me living in Tbilisi for five
          months in 2010. Falling in love with Georgia, like many who have been
          fortunate enough to visit, I returned to Georgia each year before
          meeting my lovely wife, Tea Todua. Now we have three little
          Georgian/American daughters. I am excited to help the Colorado
          Georgian Community Association become a reality.

          Lasha was born and raised in Tbilisi, Georgia. He pursued a career in
          Information Technologies and gained valuable experience working at the
          National Agency of Public Registry.
          <br /><br />
          In 2015, Lasha relocated to the United States but missed the
          close-knit Georgian community back home. Determined to bring Georgians
          together, he initiated gatherings and provided support to those in
          need in Georgia. Additionally, Lasha recognized the importance of
          preserving Georgian culture and language for future generations,
          leading to the establishment of a Georgian language Sunday school.
          <br /><br />
          Through his efforts, Lasha aims to unite Georgians living abroad and
          foster a strong sense of cultural identity and pride. His commitment
          to his homeland and community exemplifies the values our organization
          stands for.
